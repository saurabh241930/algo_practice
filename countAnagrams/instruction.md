Certainly! Here's another algorithmic question for you:

**Question:** Implement a function called `countAnagrams` that takes an array of strings as input and returns the count of all pairs of strings that are anagrams of each other.

**Parameters:**
- `strArr`: An array of strings. (1 <= strArr.length <= 100)
- The strings in the array will contain only lowercase letters.

**Example:**
```javascript
countAnagrams(['cat', 'tac', 'rat', 'art', 'act']);
// Expected Output: 4
// Explanation: There are four pairs of strings that are anagrams: ['cat', 'tac'], ['tac', 'act'], ['rat', 'art'], ['act', 'cat']
```

**Expectations:**
- Your solution should have an efficient algorithm with a time complexity of O(n * k * log(k)), where n is the number of strings in the array and k is the length of the longest string.
- The count of all pairs of strings that are anagrams should be returned.

Please attempt to solve the question and provide your solution. Once you're ready, submit your solution for evaluation, and I'll be happy to assess it.
