Certainly! Here's another algorithmic question for you:

**Question:** Given a string containing alphanumeric characters, write a function called `compressString` that compresses the string by replacing repeated consecutive characters with the character followed by the count of consecutive occurrences. If the compressed string is not shorter than the original string, your function should return the original string.

**Parameters:**
- `str`: A string containing alphanumeric characters. (1 <= str.length <= 10^4)

**Example:**
```javascript
compressString('aaabbbcccdd');
// Expected Output: 'a3b3c3d2'
```

**Expectations:**
- Your solution should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- The compressed string, if shorter than the original string, should be returned. Otherwise, the original string should be returned.
