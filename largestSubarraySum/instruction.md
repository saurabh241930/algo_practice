Certainly! Here's an advanced level algorithmic question for you:

**Question:** Implement a function called `largestSubarraySum` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the largest sum that can be obtained by summing a contiguous subarray within the input array. The subarray must contain at least one element.

**Parameters:**
- `nums`: An array of integers (1 <= nums.length <= 10^5)
- The array can contain both positive and negative numbers.

**Example:**
```javascript
largestSubarraySum([-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]);
// Expected Output: 6
// Explanation: The largest sum can be obtained by summing the subarray [4, -1, 2, 1].
```

**Expectations:**
- You should provide a solution that has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
- Your solution should handle both positive and negative numbers.
- Your code should return the largest sum possible from any contiguous subarray within the input array.

Please attempt to solve the question and provide your solution. Once you're ready, submit your solution for evaluation, and I'll be happy to assess it.
