Certainly! Here's a challenging algorithmic question for you:

**Question:** Implement a function called `minSteps` that calculates the minimum number of steps required to transform one string into another. Each step involves either adding or removing a character at any position in the string. You can only perform one operation at a time.

**Parameters:**
- `str1`: The starting string (1 <= str1.length <= 100)
- `str2`: The target string (1 <= str2.length <= 100)

**Example:**
```javascript
minSteps('table', 'tbres');
// Expected Output: 3
// Explanation: The minimum steps to transform 'table' into 'tbres' are:
// 1. Remove 'a' from 'table': 'tble'
// 2. Remove 'l' from 'tble': 'tbe'
// 3. Add 's' to 'tbe': 'tbres'
```

**Expectations:**
- You should provide a solution with an efficient algorithm and avoid brute-force approaches.
- The function should handle lowercase and uppercase letters as well as different characters.
- The minimum number of steps required to transform the starting string into the target string should be returned.
