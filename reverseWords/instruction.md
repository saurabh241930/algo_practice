Apologies for the repetition. Here's another algorithmic question for you:

**Question:** Given a string, write a function called `reverseWords` that reverses the order of the words in the string, while maintaining the order of the characters within each word.

**Parameters:**
- `str`: A string containing words separated by spaces. (1 <= str.length <= 10^4)
- Words will consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, and the spaces between them can be multiple spaces.

**Example:**
```javascript
reverseWords('Hello  World    OpenAI');
// Expected Output: 'OpenAI World Hello'
```

**Expectations:**
- Your solution should not use built-in functions like `split` or `reverse` to solve the problem.
- The words should be reversed in order, while the characters within each word should remain in the same order.
- Leading and trailing spaces should be removed in the output.
- Multiple spaces between words should be replaced with a single space.

Please attempt to solve the question and provide your solution. Once you're ready, submit your solution for evaluation, and I'll be happy to assess it.
