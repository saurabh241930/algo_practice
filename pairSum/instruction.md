Great to hear that you have solved the previous question! I'm glad to provide you with another algorithmic question. Here's one for you:

**Question:** Given an array of integers, write a function called `pairSum` that finds all pairs of numbers in the array that add up to a given target sum. The function should return an array of arrays, where each inner array contains a pair of numbers.

**Parameters:**
- `nums`: An array of integers.
- `target`: The target sum to find pairs for.

**Example:**
```javascript
pairSum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6);
// Expected Output: [[1, 5], [2, 4]]
// Explanation: Both [1, 5] and [2, 4] are pairs that add up to the target sum of 6.
```

**Expectations:**
- The pairs should not contain duplicate numbers (i.e., [2, 4] is the same as [4, 2] and should not be included twice in the result).
- The result should be an array of arrays, where each inner array contains a pair of numbers.
- The order of the pairs in the result does not matter.
- If no pairs are found that add up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.
